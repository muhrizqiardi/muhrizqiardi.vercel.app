So, turns out, for my Operating Systems class' final project, I have to do something I didn't expect--Linux from Scratch, or in other words, creating my own _Linux Distro_. At first, I panicked, cause there is no way that by Â± 4 months of learning about operating system, I already creating one. But after looking at [the website](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org), it looks fun. It's still pretty hard, but also fun. And, not to flex or anything, I already know pretty good amount of Linux commands anyway, so I think it's going to be a bit easier for me.

I mean, what's cooler than creating _your own Linux distro_!!!???

So, without further a do, let's get into it.

## 0. My setup

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1638281192/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/1.png)

- The LFS version I'm using is `11.0-systemd`, published September 1st, 2021.
- I'm using VirtualBox for the VM
- For the OS, I am using ArcoLinux, recommended by my friend (thank you qi ðŸ¤£) because it's using LFS as the foundation. I'm gonna be honest, this is also gonna be my first experience playing around with arch based OS.

## 1. Setting up VM

Let's install the OS on VM.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1638282986/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/2.png)

I'm quite surprised here, usually, when I install an OS in a VM, the screen is cropped and doesn't automatically scale, but not in ArcoLinux, apparently.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1638283174/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/4.png)

Welcome to ArcoLinux. Let's begin the installation.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1638283474/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/5.png)

I chose a password that are easy to remember for LFS.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1638283567/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/6.png)

Cool, let's wait until the installation is finished.

Oof, my computer is getting really slow, turns out opening Vscode, Spotify, Firefox, and VM isn't really a good idea ðŸ¤£...

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1638284213/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/7.png)

Uh oh... This isn't good... Let me try it again from start ðŸ˜ž. Let's pray that the same error doesn't happen at the second attempt.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1638285617/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/9_.png)

Success! Now let's start the LFS.

## 2. Chapter 2.2: Checking all the dependencies

I'm skipping the first chapter because it's mostly an introduction. Let's focus on [the second chapter](https://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter02/hostreqs.html), now.

First, we are going to check if all the required packages requirement are installed, by running commands. Copy paste below to the terminal:

```
cat > version-check.sh << "EOF"
#!/bin/bash
# Simple script to list version numbers of critical development tools
export LC_ALL=C
bash --version | head -n1 | cut -d" " -f2-4
MYSH=$(readlink -f /bin/sh)
echo "/bin/sh -> $MYSH"
echo $MYSH | grep -q bash || echo "ERROR: /bin/sh does not point to bash"
unset MYSH

echo -n "Binutils: "; ld --version | head -n1 | cut -d" " -f3-
bison --version | head -n1

if [ -h /usr/bin/yacc ]; then
  echo "/usr/bin/yacc -> `readlink -f /usr/bin/yacc`";
elif [ -x /usr/bin/yacc ]; then
  echo yacc is `/usr/bin/yacc --version | head -n1`
else
  echo "yacc not found"
fi

bzip2 --version 2>&1 < /dev/null | head -n1 | cut -d" " -f1,6-
echo -n "Coreutils: "; chown --version | head -n1 | cut -d")" -f2
diff --version | head -n1
find --version | head -n1
gawk --version | head -n1

if [ -h /usr/bin/awk ]; then
  echo "/usr/bin/awk -> `readlink -f /usr/bin/awk`";
elif [ -x /usr/bin/awk ]; then
  echo awk is `/usr/bin/awk --version | head -n1`
else
  echo "awk not found"
fi

gcc --version | head -n1
g++ --version | head -n1
ldd --version | head -n1 | cut -d" " -f2-  # glibc version
grep --version | head -n1
gzip --version | head -n1
cat /proc/version
m4 --version | head -n1
make --version | head -n1
patch --version | head -n1
echo Perl `perl -V:version`
python3 --version
sed --version | head -n1
tar --version | head -n1
makeinfo --version | head -n1  # texinfo version
xz --version | head -n1

echo 'int main(){}' > dummy.c && g++ -o dummy dummy.c
if [ -x dummy ]
  then echo "g++ compilation OK";
  else echo "g++ compilation failed"; fi
rm -f dummy.c dummy
EOF

bash version-check.sh
```

If you see a word "not" when running this, then most likely the required package is missing, and you have to install it.

Life pro tips: To make this easier, you can run `bash version-check.sh | grep "not"`, so it only shows the line that contains the word "not".

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1638287051/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/10_.png)

For me, it wasn't a problem at all, because, ArcoLinux has already included all the required software. Like I said, ArcoLinux is built with LFS.

Before continuing, I advise to read all of this carefully, don't just copy paste. You don't want to accidentally run a "destructive" command that ends up ruining your LFS and start from beginning.

Next, we are going to create a partition for LFS.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1638287463/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/11_.png)

For this, just in case, I made a new virtual hard disk with the 30GB size. We are going to use `cfdisk` to create a new partition. Before that I'm also going to log in as `root`. After that, let's run `cfdisk /dev/sdb`. (/dev/sdb is the virtual hard disk I created before)

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1638288719/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/12_.png)

You will see this screen. Select on `Free space`, set the partition size to 30G.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1638288828/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/13_.png)

After that select "write" on the bottom of screen, and type `yes` to confirm the action. You can exit the `cfdisk` by pressing ctrl + c.

After that, let's create a file system on the partition we created.

Run the command below, keep in mind that **you should replace** the `<xxx>` by the partition you created, in my case, it's `sdb1`.

```
mkfs -v -t ext4 /dev/<xxx>
```

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1638289264/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/14_.png)

Next, let's create a variable for mount directory for LFS we will create later. Run the command below:

```
export LFS=/mnt/lfs
```

Run the command below to check:

```
echo $LFS
```

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1638289667/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/15_.png)

Next, we are going to mount a directory for the LFS partition.

```
mkdir -pv $LFS
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/<xxx> $LFS
```

Replace `<xxx>` with the designation of the LFS partition.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1638289918/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/16_.png)

## 3. Chapter 3

In this chapter, we're going to download a pretty good amount of packages, so, prepare your internet.

Before that, let's create a `sources` directory at the partition we created. We'll store downloaded packages to this directory. Create the directory by running the command below:

```
mkdir -v $LFS/sources
```

After that, we'll change the directory permisssion to "sticky", which means, quoted directly from LFS' website:

> ... even if multiple users have write permission on a directory, only the owner of a file can delete the file within a sticky directory.

Run the command below to do change the permission:

```
chmod -v a+wt $LFS/sources
```

Next, we're going to create a file called `wget-list`, and copy paste the content of [this link](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/wget-list) into the file. You can use `nano`, or any text editor.

Then, run the command below:

```
wget --input-file=wget-list --continue --directory-prefix=$LFS/sources
```

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1638294656/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/17_.png)

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1638294803/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/18_.png)

Then the download will start. The duration will depend on your internet connection. ~~I hope Indihome doesn't do anything weird while I'm downloading this~~

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1638296197/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/19_.png)

Cool, the download went faster than I expected! Let's continue.

## 4. Chapter 4: Final Preparations

Next, we will run these command that will create a limited directory hierarchy, for compiling later.

```
mkdir -pv $LFS/{etc,var} $LFS/usr/{bin,lib,sbin}

for i in bin lib sbin; do
  ln -sv usr/$i $LFS/$i
done

case $(uname -m) in
  x86_64) mkdir -pv $LFS/lib64 ;;
esac
```

We will also create another directory for later in Chapter 6

```
mkdir -pv $LFS/tools
```

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1638296627/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/20_.png)

Next, we will create the LFS user, because, if we are using `root`, a single mistake can destroy a system, literally. To prevent that, for the next chapters, we will use unprivilaged user. We will name the user `lfs`.

```
groupadd lfs
useradd -s /bin/bash -g lfs -m -k /dev/null lfs
```

The meaning of the command line options, quoted from LFS' website:

`-s /bin/bash`
This makes bash the default shell for user lfs.

`-g lfs`
This option adds user lfs to group lfs.

`-m`
This creates a home directory for lfs.

`-k /dev/null`
This parameter prevents possible copying of files from a skeleton directory (default is /etc/skel) by changing the input location to the special null device.

`lfs`
This is the actual name for the created user.

Then, give the user `lfs` a password:

```
passwd lfs
```

Remember the password, cause you will use it later.

Grant lfs full access to all directories under $LFS by making lfs the directory owner:

```
chown -v lfs $LFS/{usr{,/*},lib,var,etc,bin,sbin,tools}
case $(uname -m) in
  x86_64) chown -v lfs $LFS/lib64 ;;
esac
```

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1638297301/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/21_.png)

Finally, log in to the user `lfs`, by running this commmand:

```
su - lfs
```

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1638297454/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/22_.png)

If you notice from the screenshot, after I typed the command, the user changed `root` to `lfs`.

I'll admit, the next steps are starting to be a bit... confusing. But don't fret, we will get through this ðŸ˜€!

Next, we will create a startup files for the `bash` shell. Run this command **under the `lfs` user** to create `.bash_profile` file:

```
cat > ~/.bash_profile << "EOF"
exec env -i HOME=$HOME TERM=$TERM PS1='\u:\w\$ ' /bin/bash
EOF
```

Visit [this link](https://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter04/settingenvironment.html) for the detail about this command.

Next, create `.bashrc` file:

```
cat > ~/.bashrc << "EOF"
set +h
umask 022
LFS=/mnt/lfs
LC_ALL=POSIX
LFS_TGT=$(uname -m)-lfs-linux-gnu
PATH=/usr/bin
if [ ! -L /bin ]; then PATH=/bin:$PATH; fi
PATH=$LFS/tools/bin:$PATH
CONFIG_SITE=$LFS/usr/share/config.site
export LFS LC_ALL LFS_TGT PATH CONFIG_SITE
EOF
```

And, run this command:

```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1638298596/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/23_.png)

## 5. Chapter 5

In this chapter, we will start doing a lot of compiling. I'll admit, I don't really understand a lot of the stuff in this chapter, but like I said, we will get through it, haha.

Anyway, before proceeding to this chapter, make sure you have read [this page](https://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/partintro/generalinstructions.html).

Read the notes marked _important_. It says there that, for each packages,

- extract it using `tar` command,
- go to the directory created after extracting the package, follow the book instruction, then
- go back to `/sources` directory,
- delete the extracted source directory unless instructed otherwise, and
- repeat.

Now, let's start.

First, make sure you are logged in to the user `lfs` and the current directory is `/sources`.

First, extract the `binutils-2.37.tar.xz` (the version will depend on which version you downloaded), using `tar`:

```
tar -xf "binutils-2.37.tar.xz"
```

Then, go to directory of the extracted file:

```
cd binutils-2.37/
```

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1638302558/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/2021-12-01_03.02.20_wzln6m.png)

Then, run this command to make a `build` folder and change current directory to `build`:

```
mkdir -v build
cd       build
```

Prepare binutils for compilation:

```
../configure --prefix=$LFS/tools \
             --with-sysroot=$LFS \
             --target=$LFS_TGT   \
             --disable-nls       \
             --disable-werror
```

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1638302774/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/2021-12-01_03.06.02_qxb6yt.png)

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1638302821/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/2021-12-01_03.06.52_creds7.png)

Finally, let's compile it:

```
make
```

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1638302955/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/2021-12-01_03.09.04_tccpva.png)

Then, install the package:

```
make install -j1
```

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1638303360/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/2021-12-01_03.15.42_seprmy.png)

Uh oh, looks like something is wrong. I don't know what, though. This is what happen when you skip **sleep** doing LFS ðŸ¤£.

Update 2021/12/13:

So I decided to re-install and restart from beginning, just in case I forgot some instruction.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1639389218/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/Screenshot_468_gdj0rg.png)

Accompanied by Ghibli playlist, of course.

So, here we go ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜£

I'll skip to the the chapter 5.1.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1639390253/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/Screenshot_469_nmr1kw.png)

Looks like a success! Woohoo!

Now let's change directory back to `$LFS/sources` and delete the extracted folder.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1639390780/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/2021-12-13_17.19.25_v6pfyn.png)

Let's proceed to installation of GCC. First extract gcc and cd into the the extracted folder.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1639393570/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/2021-12-13_18.05.57_vdnfcq.png)

Then, run these commands:

```
tar -xf ../mpfr-4.1.0.tar.xz
mv -v mpfr-4.1.0 mpfr
tar -xf ../gmp-6.2.1.tar.xz
mv -v gmp-6.2.1 gmp
tar -xf ../mpc-1.2.1.tar.gz
mv -v mpc-1.2.1 mpc
```

```
case $(uname -m) in
  x86_64)
    sed -e '/m64=/s/lib64/lib/' \
        -i.orig gcc/config/i386/t-linux64
 ;;
esac
```

Then, create a `build` directory, and cd into the directory.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1639393840/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/2021-12-13_18.10.25_fyf9dh.png)

Run this command to prepare for compilation

```
../configure                                       \
    --target=$LFS_TGT                              \
    --prefix=$LFS/tools                            \
    --with-glibc-version=2.11                      \
    --with-sysroot=$LFS                            \
    --with-newlib                                  \
    --without-headers                              \
    --enable-initfini-array                        \
    --disable-nls                                  \
    --disable-shared                               \
    --disable-multilib                             \
    --disable-decimal-float                        \
    --disable-threads                              \
    --disable-libatomic                            \
    --disable-libgomp                              \
    --disable-libquadmath                          \
    --disable-libssp                               \
    --disable-libvtv                               \
    --disable-libstdcxx                            \
    --enable-languages=c,c++
```

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1639393983/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/Screenshot_470_gerw1i.png)

Then run this to start compiling.

```
make
```

Also, at this point, I forgot to measure how much time it will take to compile `binutils`, which means I also don't know how much is 1 SBU. So I wrote down the time I started compiling first pass of GCC and when the compiling process is done. Turns out, it took 32 minutes to compile. First pass of GCC' compiling time is 12 SBU, so if I divide 32 by 12, the result is, **1 SBU equals to around 2.7 minutes**.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1639396427/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/Screenshot_471_dzd1lt.png)

Then install it by typing:

```
make install
```

Then run the command below:

```
cd ..
cat gcc/limitx.h gcc/glimits.h gcc/limity.h > \
  `dirname $($LFS_TGT-gcc -print-libgcc-file-name)`/install-tools/include/limits.h
```

Explanation of this command is available [here](https://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter05/gcc-pass1.html).

Lastly, remove the extracted folder of GCC.

Now let's move on to sub chapter 5.4.

First extract the file for linux header (linux-5.13.12.tar.xz), then cd into the extracted folder.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfpjmsiq/image/upload/v1639399764/blog.muhrizqiardi.me/2021-11-30%20Linux%20from%20Scratch/2021-12-13_19.48.52_wlhhbf.png)

Then run this commmand to make sure there are no stale files embedded in the package:

```
make mrproper
```

Then run this command:

```
make headers
find usr/include -name '.*' -delete
rm usr/include/Makefile
cp -rv usr/include $LFS/usr
```

This process doesn't take much time as it's only 0.1 SBU.

At last, like before, cd back into `sources` and delete the extracted folder. Finally we proceed to next sub-chapter, where we will install glibc.

Like before, first extract the tar file of glibc and cd into the the extracted folder.

```
tar -xvf glibc-2.34.tar.xz glibc-2.34/;
cd glibc-2.34;
```

Then create a symbolic link LSB complience by running these command:

```
case $(uname -m) in
    i?86)   ln -sfv ld-linux.so.2 $LFS/lib/ld-lsb.so.3
    ;;
    x86_64) ln -sfv ../lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 $LFS/lib64
            ln -sfv ../lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 $LFS/lib64/ld-lsb-x86-64.so.3
    ;;
esac
```

Next, apply the downloaded patch for this package by running this package:

```
patch -Np1 -i ../glibc-2.34-fhs-1.patch
```

Create a `build` directory and cd into it:

```
mkdir -v build
cd       build
```

First, make sure `ldconfig` and `sln` utilites are installed into `/usr/sbin`:

```
echo "rootsbindir=/usr/sbin" > configparms
```

Then prepare glibc for compilation:

```
../configure                             \
      --prefix=/usr                      \
      --host=$LFS_TGT                    \
      --build=$(../scripts/config.guess) \
      --enable-kernel=3.2                \
      --with-headers=$LFS/usr/include    \
      libc_cv_slibdir=/usr/lib
```

If you see a warning while running the command above, ignore it, cause it's mostly harmless.

Finally, let's start the compilation:

```
make
```

It's 4.2 SBU, so if my calculation is right, _in my case_ it should take about 11 minutes to compile.

So the compilation is done, now let's install it by running this command:

```
make DESTDIR=$LFS install
```

After that, fix hardcoded path to the executable loader in `ldd` script by running this command:

```
sed '/RTLDLIST=/s@/usr@@g' -i $LFS/usr/bin/ldd
```

Let's follow the caution below the command above. Run the command below:

```
echo 'int main(){}' > dummy.c
$LFS_TGT-gcc dummy.c
readelf -l a.out | grep '/ld-linux'
```

If you see something like this, it means there should be no problem.

Finally, remove all the test files.

```
rm -v dummy.c a.out
```

At last, because the cross-toolchain is complete, finalize the installation of the limits.h header by running this command:

```
$LFS/tools/libexec/gcc/$LFS_TGT/11.2.0/install-tools/mkheaders
```

Done! Now do the usual, then proceed to the next sub-chapter.

First extract the GCC tarball and change to `gcc-11.2.0` directory.

Then create `build` directory and change to it.

```
mkdir -v build
cd       build
```

Now, prepare libstdc++ for compilation by running this command:

```
../libstdc++-v3/configure           \
    --host=$LFS_TGT                 \
    --build=$(../config.guess)      \
    --prefix=/usr                   \
    --disable-multilib              \
    --disable-nls                   \
    --disable-libstdcxx-pch         \
    --with-gxx-include-dir=/tools/$LFS_TGT/include/c++/11.2.0
```

Then, compile libstdc++:

```
make
```

Finally install the library:

```
make DESTDIR=$LFS install
```

Lastly, remove the extracted folder of gcc.

Done! The chapter 5 is finally over. Let's move on to the next chapter.

## 6. Chapter 6 - Cross Compiling Temporary Tools

Before starting this chapter, make sure that you're on a user `lfs`, otherwise, you'll **render your computer useless**. Scary.

The process in this chapter is also more or less the same. Extract the tar, go in to the extracted folder, do the instruction, finally delete the extracted folder, **unless instructed otherwise**.

First, in `source` directory, extract the tar file of `m4-1.4.19.tar.xz`, then change into the `m4-1.4.19` directory.

Prepare M4 for compilation:

```
./configure --prefix=/usr   \
            --host=$LFS_TGT \
            --build=$(build-aux/config.guess)
```

Then, start compiling the package.

```
make
```

Finally, install the package

```
make DESTDIR=$LFS install
```

Do the usual, and now proceed to next sub-chapter.

First extract `ncurses-6.2.tar.gz` and change to extracted folder.

To make sure `gawk` is found first during configuration, run this:

```
sed -i s/mawk// configure
```

Then, run the following commands to build the `tic` program on the build host:

```
mkdir build
pushd build
  ../configure
  make -C include
  make -C progs tic
popd
```

Then, prepare ncurses for compilation:

```
./configure --prefix=/usr                \
            --host=$LFS_TGT              \
            --build=$(./config.guess)    \
            --mandir=/usr/share/man      \
            --with-manpage-format=normal \
            --with-shared                \
            --without-debug              \
            --without-ada                \
            --without-normal             \
            --enable-widec
```

Start compiling:

```
make
```

and finally, install it:

```
make DESTDIR=$LFS TIC_PATH=$(pwd)/build/progs/tic install
echo "INPUT(-lncursesw)" > $LFS/usr/lib/libncurses.so
```

Do the usual and let's move to compiling Bash.

Extract the tar file and change into the extracted directory. Next, prepare bash for compilation by running this:

```
./configure --prefix=/usr                   \
            --build=$(support/config.guess) \
            --host=$LFS_TGT                 \
            --without-bash-malloc
```

Then, compile the package:

```
make
```

Install the package:

```
make DESTDIR=$LFS install
```

Finally, make a link for the programs that use sh for a shell:

```
ln -sv bash $LFS/bin/sh
```

Do the usual and let's move on to next package, Coreutils.

First extract the tar file of coreutils, and change into extracted directory.

Prepare for compilation:

```
./configure --prefix=/usr                     \
            --host=$LFS_TGT                   \
            --build=$(build-aux/config.guess) \
            --enable-install-program=hostname \
            --enable-no-install-program=kill,uptime
```

Then compile the package:

```
make
```

Next, install the package:

```
make DESTDIR=$LFS install
```

According to the website, we should move programs to their final expected locations, because some programs hard-code executable locations. Run these commands:

```
mv -v $LFS/usr/bin/chroot                                     $LFS/usr/sbin
mkdir -pv $LFS/usr/share/man/man8
mv -v $LFS/usr/share/man/man1/chroot.1                        $LFS/usr/share/man/man8/chroot.8
sed -i 's/"1"/"8"/'                                           $LFS/usr/share/man/man8/chroot.8
```

Do the usual, and let's move on to the next package, diffutils. This one is extremely easy, so I'm just gonna give you a link to the LFS website for this: [https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter06/diffutils.html](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter06/diffutils.html)
