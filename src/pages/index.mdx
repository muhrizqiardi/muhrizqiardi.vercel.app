A software engineer focused on frontend website development. Currently studying Informatics Engineering at [State University of Surabaya](https://unesa.ac.id).

From a young age, I've always been drawn to creating and crafting. Whether it's folding intricate origami designs or coding a program in Visual Basic, I love the process of bringing something new into the world. My ultimate goal is to use my skills and talents to create something that has a positive impact on others. That's what drives me and gives me purpose. And I hope to continue doing just that for the rest of my journey.
